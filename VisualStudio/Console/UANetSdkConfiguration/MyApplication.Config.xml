         Typical web browsing applications trust any certificate issued by a CA in the 
         "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" certificate store. However, this approach is 
         not appropriate for UA because Administrators have no control over the CAs that get
         placed in that Root store to facilitate web browsing. This means Administrators must
         specify a different store that is used only for UA related CAs and/or they must explicitly
         specify the certificate for each trusted certification authority. -->

         Some UA applications will use self-signed certificates (certificates without a CA)
         which means that every application which communicates with it must be configured to 
         trust it.
         
         Administrators may designate a certificate store that contains trusted UA application 
         instance certificates (this store should not be the same as the store used for CAs 
         certificates). Alternately, Administrators may enter the certificates explicitly in
         this list.
         
         Note that entries in this list may either reference a certificate in the store or
         may contained the entire certificate encoded as base64 data.
